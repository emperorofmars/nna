**Extend any 3d format by abusing node-names to store data!**

toc::[]

It works by serializing data into node-names in the scene hierarchy.
This is about as heretical as it sounds, but it works, very well.

== Why
FBX is the current best 3D interchange format. Sadly, it is non-extensible and undocumented, hardly optimal.
This is a way to add additional information to 3d models in any format, primarily FBX.

The best case would be if a proper open & extensible 3d interchange format was created. In that case I'll happily delete this^^
https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity[I created a proof-of-concept of such a format]. Alone it is of course not practically possible to bring such a project into a widely available production ready state. This is the next best thing.

== Goals
* A 3d file should be a self-contained single source of truth for all its functionality, and work across different game engines.
* Artists without technical knowledge beyond 3d modeling, should have an easy time creating VR & V-Tubing avatars.
* End users without technical knowledge, should be able to easily adapt and upload VR & V-Tubing avatars.
