# ⛧ NNA - Node Name Abuse ⛧
Extend any 3d format by abusing node-names to store data!\
This project is an abomination and the sooner it can burn in a fire, the better.

**Get it for:**
* Blender: <https://github.com/emperorofmars/nna_blender>
* Unity: <https://github.com/emperorofmars/nna_unity>

**This repository provides the documentation for the format and available component-types.**
* [Core Specification](nna_spec.md)
* [Available Component Types](nna_component_types.md)
* [Roadmap](roadmap.md)

⭐ Star this repo if you love heresy! ⭐

### Why
Existing 3d interchange formats are bad. The least horrible one, FBX, is not extensible.
This is a way to add additional information to 3d models in any format, primarily FBX.

The best case would be if a proper open & extensible 3d interchange format was created. In that case I'll happily delete this^^\
[I created a proof-of-concept of such a format](https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity). Alone it is of course not practically possible to bring such a project into a widely available production ready state.\
[If you are asking yourself why wouldn't glTF 2.0 just work, read this!](https://gist.github.com/emperorofmars/d8abf0f4b9bd5434f9543511b243a254)

### Goals
* A 3d file should be a self-contained single source of truth for all its functionality, and work across different game engines.
* Artists without technical knowledge beyond 3d modeling, should have an easy time creating VR & V-Tubing avatars.
* End users without technical knowledge, should be able to easily adapt and upload VR & V-Tubing avatars.

I am disgusted by myself for making this.

Cheers!

Or something.
