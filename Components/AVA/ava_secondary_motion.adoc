Specifies the root of a bone chain to be animated based on runtime physics.

**This component is incredibly rudimentary as of now and will be significantly reworked.**

This is supposed to be used as a universally compatible fallback component to specify bone physics.\
Components specific to target applications should be implemented, which can override this one.
